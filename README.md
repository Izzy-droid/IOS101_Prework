# App Brainstorming-
# Youtube:  Lots of different music/video clips and custom playlists
# Netflix: different language subtitles and separate genres for content
# Discord: easy to make friends and good video call quality



# I want to make an app that'll teach sign language, I don't have know too much what would be put besides the standard lessons with videos for it. It could connect others to help each other learn.
